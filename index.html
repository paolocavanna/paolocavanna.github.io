            <h1>About</h1>
            <p>I live in Vercelli, Italy and I work as lead front end developer at <a
                    href="https://www.motork.io/">MotorK</a> company in Milan.
            <p>I came from a humanistic background and, thus it doesn't look like a normal path heading to
                transform me into a code nerd, I took advantage from my classical studies and my master degree
                in arts.</p>
            <p>My first encounter with the world of web was more SEO oriented. I got more and more into the web
                world and I decided to turn this passion into a job.</p>

            <h1>Skills &amp; competences</h1>
            <p>Everyday, I focus my attention and my efforts on front end development and its coding weapons:
                HTML, CSS and JavaScript.</p>
            <p>Like all web developers, I have to put up with bug-ridden Internet Explorer: consequently, I am
                now familiar with efficient <strong>cross browser coding principles</strong>, starting from a
                solid HTML base and all the way through to
                clean CSS and unobtrusive JavaScript. </p>
            <p>I work with <strong>AJAX</strong> based applications on a daily basis, playing with
                <strong>JSON</strong> and <strong>XML</strong>, especially when fetching data from the major
                social networks through their APIs.
            </p>
            <p>With the advent of new and exciting web technologies such as <strong>HTML5</strong> and
                <strong>CSS3</strong> coming towards, I work everyday to keep up to date and follow the road of
                <strong>progressive enhancement</strong>, helping
                people live a great browsing experience.
